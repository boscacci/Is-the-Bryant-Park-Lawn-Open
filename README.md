Uses AWS Lambda to scrape the web with a headless browser, collecting one bit of information. Saves that binary variable to a database and references that database to keep an s3 bucket site updated. Renders some aggregate statistics as plotly visualizations on a second page.

- Lambda / SAM
- S3
- RDS
